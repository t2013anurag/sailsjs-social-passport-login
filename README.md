Basic example to intergrate Facebook with Sails.JS
---------------------------------------------------

Please follow the instructions on [sailsjs.org](http://sailsjs.org) to launch SailsJS.

In order to utilize the application, please modify: **config/middleware.js**; change the *CLIENTID* and *CLIENTSECRET*.

                passport.use(new FacebookStrategy({
                clientID: "CLIENTID",
                clientSecret: "CLIENTSECRET",
                callbackURL: "http://localhost:1337/auth/facebook/callback",
                },

Please run npm install before lifting Sails.

Sails.JS is an impressive Node.JS Framework, and I've been playing around with it for the last two-weeks. I hope you enjoy and utilize this framework as much as I do. 

**Note**: The current settings are built to use *Mongo*. You can change to local by changing the adapter settings.
